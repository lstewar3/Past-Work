#Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation 
#between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is 
#greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold 
#requirement. If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0.

        if(nobs>threshold){
            return (cor(data$nitrate, data$sulfate, use="complete.obs"))
        }

 ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the location of the CSV files

        ## 'threshold' is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
        ## number of completely observed observations (on all
        ## variables) required to compute the correlation between
        ## nitrate and sulfate; the default is 0

        ## Return a numeric vector of correlations
        ## NOTE: Do not round the result!
