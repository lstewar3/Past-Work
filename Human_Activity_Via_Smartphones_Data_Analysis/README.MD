# - This analysis measures human activity recognition via smartphones
- I have written a code to measure specific pieces of the overall experiement outcomes. 
- Please note that you can find more information on the experiment here ->

The `run_analysis.R` code will do the following 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result will be the `tidy.txt` file.
